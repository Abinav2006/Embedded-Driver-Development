# Embedded-Driver-Development
Bare-metal driver development projects for the STM32F446RE microcontroller using STM32CubeIDE. This repository contains low-level peripheral drivers written without relying on HAL or CMSIS abstractions. Focused on gaining a deep understanding of ARM Cortex-M4 and STM32 hardware through register-level programming.
